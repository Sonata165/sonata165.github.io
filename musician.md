    I embarked on my musical odyssey at the age of four. My foundational years were shaped under Xu Hongdu of the Shaanxi Musician's Association, followed by an enriching mentorship with Ji Xiaoquan, the distinguished former principal violinist at the Shaanxi Provincial Song and Dance Theatre Orchestra. My artistic prowess was further sculpted under the tutelage of Tian Hui, a leading figure in the Xi'an Conservatory of Music, and subsequently refined by Liang Danan, a revered professor at the Central Conservatory of Music. Each phase of my journey has been a testament to my unwavering commitment and exceptional skill, setting me apart as a musician of rare caliber and passion.

In recent years, I have primarily focused on arranging and performing contemporary pop music, encompassing recording and post-production work. My affection for vibrant, energetic songs aligns perfectly with the vivacious timbre of the violin, creating a dynamic fusion that captivates audiences. Furthermore, I've embarked on an exciting new venture: mastering guitar solos. Leveraging my violin skills, I've found a seamless transition to the guitar, blending its harmonic capabilities with my own flair. This fusion not only showcases my versatility but also offers listeners a richer, more diverse musical experience. My journey into guitar solo performance is yet another stride in my ever-evolving artistic narrative, continually pushing the boundaries of musical expression.
