    My journey into music began at the tender age of four, laying the foundation for a lifelong passion. Early on, I was fortunate to study under Xu Hongdu of the Shaanxi Musician's Association. My learning journey continued under the guidance of Ji Xiaoquan, the esteemed former concertmaster of the Shaanxi Provincial Song and Dance Theatre Orchestra. My skills were further honed with Tian Hui, a prominent figure at the Xi'an Conservatory of Music, and later with <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%BB%84%E6%99%93%E8%8A%9D/6106409" target="_blank">Professor Huang Xiaozhi (黄晓芝)</a> and <a href="https://baike.baidu.hk/item/%E6%A2%81%E5%A4%A7%E5%8D%97/2844089" target="_blank">Professor Liang Danan (梁大南)</a>, respected maestros at the Central Conservatory of Music. Additionally, it's worth mentioning that throughout my six years in secondary school, I was an active participant in the Xi'an Tieyi High School Symphony Orchestra's rehearsals and performances, serving as the violin concertmaster for two years. Each step of my journey underscores my dedication and distinct talent, distinguishing me as a musician of unique depth and fervor.

In recent years, I have primarily focused on arranging and performing contemporary pop music, encompassing recording and post-production work. My affection for vibrant, energetic songs aligns perfectly with the vivacious timbre of the violin, creating a dynamic fusion that captivates audiences. Furthermore, I've embarked on an exciting new venture: mastering guitar solos. Leveraging my violin skills, I've found a seamless transition to the guitar, blending its harmonic capabilities with my own flair. This fusion not only showcases my versatility but also offers listeners a richer, more diverse musical experience. My journey into guitar solo performance is yet another stride in my ever-evolving artistic narrative, continually pushing the boundaries of musical expression.
