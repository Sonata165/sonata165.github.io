  <p>
    I am currently a proud PhD candidate (2nd year) in the [Sound and Music Computing Lab](https://smcnus.comp.nus.edu.sg/), School of Computing, National University of Singapore. My research centers on solving music information retrieval challenges using machine learning techniques. I am particularly interested in the automatic transcription of music and lyrics, as well as lyric generation. Prior to joining NUS, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with honors from the Harbin Institute of Technology. 
    <br> <br>
    Moreover, I am a professional-level violinist and guitarist. Please visit the "<a href="/musician">As Musician</a>" page to explore my music portfolio. I feel incredibly fortunate to have discovered my passion for music and to have the opportunity to work and conduct research in a music-related field. My love for music energizes and motivates me to continually grow and excel in this area.

# Other Projects
- [**GNN-based Music Recommender**](https://github.com/Sonata165/MusicRecommenderGCN)  
    This project aims to tackle the music artist recommendation challenge using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). By modeling artist and user identities through their interactive relationships, the network predicts affinity scores between users and previously unexplored artists to generate personalized recommendations. I implemented the original GCN as a baseline and proposed three enhancements: incorporating edge weight for aggregation, augmenting edge weight with attention mechanisms, and implementing data augmentation by introducing noise to edge values.

- [**DNA Storage Simulation**](https://github.com/Sonata165/DNA-Storage-Simulation)  
    DNA-based storage systems present unique challenges, as reading and writing operations can sometimes result in alterations to the original information. To model the changes introduced by such storage systems in a wet lab environment, we designed a simulation system to emulate DNA behavioral changes. This system includes a rule-based method, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) method, and a sequence-to-sequence attention-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The experiments based on the Microsoft Nanopore dataset shows the sequence-to-sequence method is highly effective.
